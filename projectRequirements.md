**COS 2021 Fundamental Data Structures**

Project Requirements

The Class Project assignment for the COS 2021 course is an individual work. Every student must develop independently a substantial program, using the C++ programming language and appropriate development environment, such as MS Visual Studio or any other C++ development environment. **Every student is responsible to propose** **the topic (problem) of the project and to seek approval by the instructor by the end of the sixth week of the semester**.

**A project needs to have all the following required properties:**

- Uses **at least a three-level hierarchy of classes exploring inheritance, where at least one function is polymorphic** (virtual) and the polymorphic properties are essential for the driver program.
    
- Loads the initial data from **input file(s)**, as opposed to having it hard-coded in the driver program.
    
- Uses data structures to organize **collection(s) of objects**, e.g., single collection of different kind of objects organized by **exploring the polymorphic definition** of the behavior of the different objects.
    
- Uses **algorithms to manipulate collection(s)**, with evaluated and optimal algorithm quality.
    

- (1) You may choose data structure(s) among the studied during the course. In that case, you do not need to perform algorithmâ€™s performance evaluation.
    
- (2) You must use effective algorithms as studied in class. For example, using bubble sort or any other O(N2) algorithms will result immediately with 10% lower grade for the entire project.
    

**Grading**

The grade is based on the two parts of the project: developed software and program design and documentation.

**The software part of the project will be graded according to the following rules:**

- Existence of compile-time errors not more than 20 %
    
- Existence of run-time errors not more than 50 %
    
- Existence of logical errors not more than 60 %
    
- Correct program not less than 80 %
    

The remaining 20 points will be awarded for program efficiency, design of classes, structure, layout, etc.

**Note:** Missing some of the properties of the project defined above will be counted as logical errors!

**The documentation part of the project will be graded according to the percentages, given in the table below.**

**By the end of the sixth week** every student has to propose and discuss with the instructor an idea about the problem to solve for the class project. Students, faculty, or staff can propose topics for the Project. Students, who do not have approved topics for the project, will be given assignments by the instructor. At the end of the **sixth week** all ideas for projects must be defined and approved.

Students must present in writing a detailed description of the functionality of the program they are planning to develop (program specification). Deadline is **the end of the seventh week**. The specification must be uploaded on Canvas by the specified deadline and should contain:

- Short (one or two paragraph) description of the problem
    
- The three-level hierarchy of classes, proposed by the student and corresponding to the problem domain
    
- A clear statement about what will represent the collection of objects and what functionality will be implemented (algorithms for collection update and use)
    
- A clear statement describing the polymorphic functions.
    

After the project specification has been submitted, any changes to it require the **permission** of the instructor.

**Changes in project topics are not allowed after the 10****th** **week of the semester!**

**The project must be ready entirely and submitted for presentation by the end of the 12****th** **week of the semester!**

It is required that the project development passes through the following stages. The **deadlines are obligatory**. For any stage you have to develop and submit the specified (in bold) deliverables through Canvas.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
   
|Phase|Activities and Deliverables|Deadline|Weight for the Project Grade|
|1|Approving project idea and developing specification<br><br>**Deliverables: Project Specification**|Week 7|10%|
|2|Program design: ADT, classes and algorithms<br><br>**Deliverables: ADT, hierarchy of classes, description and evaluation of the algorithms**|Week 9|30%|
|3|Implementation: Writing the program, debugging and testing<br><br>**Deliverables: Source code and a working program**|Week 12|40%|
|4|Project Presentations and Demos<br><br>**Deliverables: Short PPT Presentation, User Guide**|Week 13|20%|

**The complete set of files, representing the final versions of all the deliverables for your project, included documentation, must be stored in an archive (zip, rar, etc.) and submitted on Canvas before your presentation.**

The percentages define the share of grading of the given part of the project from the total grade of the project. Late submissions will be accepted but penalized with 15% for each day after the deadline (15% during the first, 30% during the second day, etc.).
